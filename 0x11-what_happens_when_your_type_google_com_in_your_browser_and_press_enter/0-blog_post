What Happens When You Type "https://www.google.com" and Press Enter?

When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, a series of events occurs to fetch and display the Google homepage. 

1. DNS Request
The first step is resolving the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address that the browser can use to locate Google's servers. This process involves a DNS (Domain Name System) request:

Browser Cache: The browser checks its cache to see if it has recently resolved the domain.

Operating System Cache: If the browser cache doesn't have the information, it checks the operating system cache.

Router Cache: The request goes to your router, which may also have a cached DNS entry.

ISP DNS Server: If none of the caches have the entry, the request is sent to your ISP's DNS server, which starts querying other DNS servers if necessary.

2. TCP/IP
Once the IP address is obtained, the browser initiates a TCP/IP connection to Google's server:

TCP Handshake: This involves a three-step process known as the TCP handshake:
SYN: Your browser sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
SYN-ACK: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
ACK: Your browser sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server, establishing a connection.
IP Routing: The data packets are routed across the internet using IP (Internet Protocol), hopping through various routers and networks until they reach the destination server.

3. Firewall
Firewalls play a crucial role in securing the network:

Client Firewall: Your device's firewall checks outgoing requests and allows the connection to proceed if it deems the request safe.
Server Firewall: Google's firewall examines incoming requests to filter out any malicious traffic, ensuring only legitimate requests reach the server.

4. HTTPS/SSL
To ensure the data exchanged between your browser and Google's server is secure, HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is used:

SSL/TLS Handshake: This involves:
Certificate Exchange: Google's server presents an SSL certificate to your browser, which verifies the certificate with a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
Session Key: A session key is generated and exchanged securely, enabling encrypted communication.
5. Load Balancer

Given the massive traffic Google handles, a load balancer is used to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers:

Load Balancing Algorithms: Common algorithms include Round Robin, Least Connections, and IP Hash. These algorithms ensure no single server is overwhelmed, improving performance and reliability.
6. Web Server
Once the request reaches one of Google's servers, the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) takes over:

Handling Requests: The web server processes the incoming HTTP request, determining which resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files) need to be served.

Static Content: If the request is for static content, the web server fetches and serves the files directly.

7. Application Server
For dynamic content, the request is forwarded to an application server:

Processing Logic: The application server runs the necessary backend logic, interacting with databases and other services to generate the required content.
Technologies: Common application servers include Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, and others.

8. Database
If the request involves data retrieval or storage, the application server interacts with a database:

Query Execution: The application server sends SQL or NoSQL queries to the database to fetch or store data.
Response Generation: The database processes the queries and returns the results, which the application server uses to generate the final response.

9. Response
Finally, the generated response travels back through the same path:

Application Server to Web Server: The dynamic content is sent back to the web server.

Web Server to Load Balancer: The web server passes the response to the load balancer.

Load Balancer to Client: The load balancer routes the response back to your browser.

10. Rendering
Your browser receives the response and starts rendering the content:

HTML Parsing: The browser parses the HTML to construct the Document Object Model (DOM).

CSS and JavaScript: The browser fetches and applies CSS for styling and executes JavaScript for interactivity.

Final Display: The browser displays the fully rendered page, allowing you to interact with Google's homepage.
