Repo contains alx-system_engineering-devops such as scipting assignments

0x01-shell_permissions another of the folders and a revelation hit me the system is already in place now to understand how it flows
This is exceeding relevant to grasp and I have accepted to pay what it takes
Jesus is truly a wonder!
All glory to Him Our Father
More assignments on DevOps and Cloud services opened to me How this section actually is intrinisic in my journey
Things like shell, basics and permissions took precedence
How Shell works has opened my mind to a mind-blowing prethora of importances like an AWS CLI to manipulate files on a cloud server
knowldege of a Unix-like O.S especially Linux is Key
Permsissions on how has access to what files and resources within a system
What authority does one have to give a particular set of intructions as scripts
Automation of tasks using shell scripting is Amazing
All Glory to God and His Son Jesus!
