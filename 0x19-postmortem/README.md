### Postmortem: Service Outage on Aug 17, 2024

#### Issue Summary
- **Duration:** August 17, 2024, 08:00 - 10:45 UTC
- **Impact:** The user authentication service was intermittently down. Approximately 30% of users experienced login failures and degraded performance during this period.
- **Root Cause:** A configuration error in the load balancer led to uneven traffic distribution and overload of backend authentication servers.

#### Timeline
- **08:00 UTC** - Issue detected: Login failures reported by customers through support tickets.
- **08:05 UTC** - Detection method: Initial monitoring alerts indicated a spike in error rates and slow response times.
- **08:15 UTC** - Actions taken: Engineers investigated server logs and network traffic. Assumed root cause was a potential issue with backend authentication servers.
- **08:30 UTC** - Misleading path: Initial focus on backend server issues and database performance was ineffective.
- **08:45 UTC** - Escalation: Incident escalated to the network operations team and senior engineers.
- **09:00 UTC** - Resolution efforts: Network operations team identified misconfigured load balancer settings.
- **09:30 UTC** - Fix implemented: Corrected load balancer configuration to ensure even traffic distribution.
- **10:00 UTC** - Confirmation: Verified that the service was restored and user login issues were resolved.
- **10:45 UTC** - Incident closed: Final review conducted to confirm the issue was resolved and systems were stable.

#### Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause:** A recent configuration change to the load balancer inadvertently caused traffic to be unevenly distributed, overwhelming some authentication servers while leaving others underutilized. This led to server overloads and login failures.
- **Resolution:** Corrected the load balancer settings to distribute traffic evenly across all authentication servers. Implemented a rollback plan for configuration changes and conducted a thorough review of the load balancer configuration procedures.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Improvements Needed:**
  - **Configuration Management:** Implement stricter change management processes for load balancer configurations to prevent misconfigurations.
  - **Monitoring and Alerts:** Enhance monitoring to include alerts for uneven traffic distribution and server load imbalances.
  - **Testing Procedures:** Introduce more rigorous testing and validation of configuration changes in a staging environment before production deployment.

- **Specific Tasks:**
  1. **Update Configuration Management Protocols:** Review and strengthen the protocol for load balancer configuration changes, including additional approval steps.
  2. **Implement Advanced Monitoring:** Add specific monitoring for load balancer traffic distribution and server load metrics. Set up alerts for deviations from normal traffic patterns.
  3. **Improve Testing Procedures:** Develop and deploy a more comprehensive testing suite for configuration changes, including load testing and validation in a staging environment.
  4. **Review Incident Response Plan:** Update the incident response plan to include clearer guidelines for handling load balancer and traffic distribution issues.

By addressing these areas, we aim to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future and improve our overall system reliability.


### Postmortem: The Great Login Debacle of August 17, 2024

#### Issue Summary
- **Duration:** August 17, 2024, 08:00 - 10:45 UTC
- **Impact:** Users were locked out of their accounts, with 30% experiencing login failures. Imagine trying to get into a VIP party and finding out the bouncer's lost the guest list!
- **Root Cause:** A misconfigured load balancer was like an overzealous party bouncer, letting only a few guests through and ignoring the rest.

#### Timeline
- **08:00 UTC** - *Ding Dong!* - Users start calling us saying they canâ€™t log in. Itâ€™s like everyoneâ€™s been locked out of the party.
- **08:05 UTC** - *Alert! Alert!* - Monitoring tools sound the alarm with spikes in error rates. The party's getting chaotic.
- **08:15 UTC** - *Server Sleuthing:* Engineers dive into server logs, assuming the issue lies with the authentication servers. Turns out, itâ€™s not the DJâ€™s fault but the bouncer's.
- **08:30 UTC** - *Lost in the Crowd:* Initial focus on backend servers and databases proved fruitless. The real issue was the load balancerâ€™s bad mood.
- **08:45 UTC** - *The Big Guns Arrive:* Network ops and senior engineers swoop in. They start looking at the load balancerâ€”the bouncer who lost the guest list.
- **09:00 UTC** - *Fix in Progress:* Configuration of the load balancer adjusted to evenly distribute the crowd. The partyâ€™s back on!
- **09:30 UTC** - *Back to Normal:* Verified that the login issues are resolved. Everyone's back in the party.
- **10:00 UTC** - *Cool Down:* Monitored to ensure everything was stable. The partyâ€™s winding down, and everyoneâ€™s happy.
- **10:45 UTC** - *Case Closed:* Incident report wrapped up, and the bouncer is given a new checklist.

#### Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause:** The load balancer was misconfigured, directing all traffic to just a few servers. It was like having only one door open at a busy concert, while the rest were closed.
- **Resolution:** Reconfigured the load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across all authentication servers. Implemented a rollback strategy for future configurations to ensure any missteps can be quickly undone.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Improvements Needed:**
  - **Configuration Control:** Tighten up change management so the load balancer doesnâ€™t accidentally go rogue again.
  - **Enhanced Monitoring:** Add specific alerts for traffic distribution issues. No more surprise party crashes!
  - **Thorough Testing:** Ensure configuration changes are rigorously tested in a staging environment before going live. No more uninvited guests.

- **Specific Tasks:**
  1. **Revamp Configuration Procedures:** Implement a more stringent approval process for load balancer changes, including additional checks.
  2. **Upgrade Monitoring Tools:** Add monitoring for load distribution and server load with proactive alerts.
  3. **Improve Testing:** Develop a comprehensive testing plan for configuration changes, including stress testing and validation.
  4. **Refine Incident Response:** Update the response plan to better address load balancer issues and avoid future misconfigurations.

When the load balancer turns into a party bouncer who loses the guest list. This is how the crowd was unevenly distributed!"*

In summary, we had a minor party snafu, but with the right changes, weâ€™re now ready to throw an even better bash! ðŸŽ‰
