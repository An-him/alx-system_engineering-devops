## command_line_for_the_win
To connect to a remote server I used SSH:
By typing: sftp and entering the hostname[could look a little cryptic]
###### sftp 343586c65427@343586c65427.dd0356c3.alx-cod.online
password will be asked [While entering password no text will show on the next screen]
If password is valid: access is granted
If not [Prompt returns indicating wrong password]
##### Password 50a70e3066e16e1b [Ofcourse this isn't the password But you get the narrative]
prompt will look something like = sftp>
navigating into the directory where to put the files create it if it dont exist
Using the command put specifying which path/file to put into it
Worked better than magic!
