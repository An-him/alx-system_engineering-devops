Firewalls:

Firewall 1: Protects the entire infrastructure from external threats.
Firewall 2, 3, 4: Protect individual servers within the internal network, adding an extra layer of security.
Load Balancer:

Distributes incoming traffic evenly across the web servers.
Terminates SSL, decrypting incoming HTTPS traffic before passing it to the web servers.
Web Servers (Nginx):

Serve static content.
Proxy requests to the application servers.
Application Servers:

Handle the business logic and dynamic content generation.
Communicate with the database servers for data operations.
Database (MySQL):

Master/Slave configuration: One master server for write operations and slave servers for read operations.
Ensures high availability and load distribution for database queries.
SSL Certificate:

Ensures that traffic between the user's browser and the load balancer is encrypted, providing data integrity and security.

Monitoring Clients:

Installed on each server to collect performance metrics and log data.
Send collected data to a centralized monitoring service like Sumologic for analysis and alerting.
Additional Element Explanations
Firewalls:

Protect servers from unauthorized access and various types of cyber attacks.
HTTPS (SSL/TLS):

Encrypts data in transit, ensuring privacy and integrity of the data exchanged between the user and the server.
Monitoring:

Collects data on server performance, availability, and security.
Helps in proactive issue detection, capacity planning, and troubleshooting.
Monitoring Tool Data Collection:

Monitoring clients collect data on CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic, application logs, etc.
Data is sent to a centralized monitoring service for analysis, visualization, and alerting.
Monitoring Web Server QPS
Install monitoring clients on the web servers.
Configure the clients to collect specific metrics related to HTTP requests (QPS - Queries Per Second).
Send the data to a centralized monitoring service (e.g., Sumologic).
Set up dashboards and alerts within the monitoring service to track QPS and notify you of any anomalies.
Issues with This Infrastructure
SSL Termination at Load Balancer:

Decrypting SSL at the load balancer exposes the traffic to potential interception within the internal network.
Internal communication between load balancer and servers is unencrypted unless additional measures are taken.
Single Write-capable MySQL Server:

The master database server is a single point of failure for write operations.
If the master server fails, no write operations can be performed until it is restored or a new master is promoted.
Homogeneous Server Components:

Each server having web server, application server, and database components can lead to resource contention.
Difficult to scale individual components independently, leading to inefficiencies in resource utilization.
Increases complexity in managing and maintaining each server.
